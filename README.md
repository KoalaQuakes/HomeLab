Setup Network Monitoring tool - Prometheus

Project Aim:

For the outset of this project, the idea is to utilise and re-purpose existing hardware. Existing hardware includes:

Desktop PC - i5-4670 CPU, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD
HP Envy - i5-7440 CPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD
Rasberry Pi 4 - 4GB RAM
Asus laptop - M3 CPU, ?? RAM, 128GB SSD
Desktop PC and HP Envy should be virtualised to split into virtual machines.

Special emphasis should be placed on documentation from both a learning and future lessons perspective.
