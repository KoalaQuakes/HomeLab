## Observability & Operations

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for:
  - Cluster health
  - Resource utilization
  - Application latency
- Alerting rules for:
  - Node failures
  - High error rates
  - Disk pressure

Incident simulations are periodically run to validate alerting.
